# Soccer Position Tracker

### What is this?
This is an exercise in working with [EPTS data](https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/477d8daa7f0ac4c9/original/standard-transfer-format-documentation.pdf), a standard format by FIFA for tracking the position of soccer players and the ball.

The goal is to build something that will:
1. Track my position during games
1. Convert position data into EPTS format
1. Support visual playback of tracked games (e.g. watching my dot move on a field)

### TODO:
✅ Generate valid EPTS metadata
- Successfully collect and store position data during games
- Convert position data into valid EPTS tracking data matching schema defined in metadata
- Build interface to play back tracked games
